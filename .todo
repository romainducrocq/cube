cython:
- see if better to refactor every return scope into sub functions:
    => make use of static typing declaration
    => declare only cdef needed for scope
    => readability
    => eg:
    - cpdef AstType do_something(AstType node):
        if isinstance(node, type1):
            _do_something_type1(node)
            ...
        if isinstance(node, type2):
            _do_something_type2(node)
            ...

- for c build:
    - add readme with code limitations
    - add ./configure
        - download + install python from sources with --enable-shared
        - auto replace /opt/Python3.9.18/ with path in build files
    - debug exceptions
    - if ok: add to build / install
    - update driver to chose the version that is installed in /ccc/

- see if can remove deepcopy:
    - int => cdef int x_new = x_old + 0
    - str => cdef str s_new = s_old + ""
